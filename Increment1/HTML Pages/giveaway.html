<h1 style="font-family:comic sans ms">Now a days, students travel to different countries in order to pursue their higher studies, students face a lot of difficulties in getting adjusted to the new environment, cross culture and in various other aspects. The major problem they face is to gather the household items in the initial stages. The basic household items can be arranged by themselves, but when it comes to the point of major ones, it is difficult for them to manage their money on these large household items. In well developed countries like US and UK, there are some non-profit organizations which donate household items to the newly arrived students. But, it is a bit difficult for the students to get in touch with these organizations. So, we need an application, which can bring these organizations and the students closer.
